### Topic: An introduction to multi-output Gaussian processes using PyMC

Multi-output Gaussian processes have recently gained strong attention from researchers and have become an active research topic in machine learningâ€™s multi-task learning. The advantage of multi-output Gaussian processes is their capacity to simultaneously learn and infer many outputs which have a similar source of uncertainty from inputs.

This talk presents to audiences how to build multi-output Gaussian processes in PyMC. It first introduces the concept of Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-output GPs and how they can address real problems in several domains. It then shows how to implement multi-output GPs models such as the intrinsic coregionalization model (ICM) and the linear model of coregionalization (LCM) in Python using PyMC with real-world datasets.
